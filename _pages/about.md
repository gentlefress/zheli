I graduated from the School of Biology, Hunan University in 2021. And now I'm a third year master student from School of CS (http://www.cs.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.cn/). My research interest includes motion generation, 3D vision model, and multimodal learning. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Laurence T. Yang](https://faculty.hust.edu.cn/yangtianruo/zh_CN/index/1155249/list/index.htm) of CPSS Lab from [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.hust.edu.cn/).
